# Sample using Angular JS and Web API

This sample is a skeleton framework that shows AngularJS communicating with Web API via
JWT.  The login system works and it is able to send and retrieve data via REST.

On the front end, this system utilizes npm, bower, and gulp for the build process.

## Installation

#### Web API
    1. Open the API solution in Visual Studio 2015
    2. Right click on the API solution and select 'Restore NuGet Packages'
    3. Execute the project (F5).

#### Web
    1. Install [node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
    2. From a command line, in the web folder run 'npm install'.
    3. Execute the front-end build process via 'gulp serve'
    4. From the login screen, select 'Register a new account' to get started.
